/* 
What are the two 'types' of learning we alternate
between here at AppAcademy? What are three examples 
of each?

1. Active learning 
  1. Allow us to engage with the material.
  2. Give us space to receive feedback on our progress.
  3. Feel difficult.
2. Passive learning
  1. Do not let us engage the material.
  2. Do not have any source of feedback.
  3. Feel relatively easy.

What is Desirable Difficulty?
- When effective learners desire challenge.
